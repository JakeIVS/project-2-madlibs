Deliverables:
- store a number of different starting madlib templates, showing buttons to choose which one to go with
- add a form to fill out, specifying each needed word in the madlib
- when form is submitted, show a completed madlib
-don't allow form to submit if any fields are blank

Advanced Deliverables:
- form validation should work for specific word requirements in form ("verb ending in 'ing'", etc.)
- each form field should have a button that fills the field with a random word that matches requirements
- add a button that will save completed madlib to seperate JSON,
