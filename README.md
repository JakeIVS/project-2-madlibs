---MadLibs Generator---

This react app allows you to do two main things:
-Fill in MadLibs templates, generating your own story which you can save and view later
-Create your own templates, which can be used and filled in the same way as the included templates

To get started, run npm install, then npm run start and npm run dev in two seperate terminals.


-DESCRIPTION-
Write your own MadLibs! Choose a template and fill in the blanks with the types of words indicated in the input. Once you are done, hit Submit and see the complete MadLib story with the words you entered! Click the save button in the upper right corner to save your story for viewing later (from the "View Saved" tab).

Want to write your own template? Click the "New Template" button in the top right corner of the Template Selector screen. This will bring up a form to fill out. Enter your story name and, in the first text input field, write your template up to the first blank you want to insert. Then, simply choose the type of word you want the blank to require from the dropdown list. After that, a new text input and dropdown should appear for you to continue writing. Continue this process until your story is complete (make sure the last dropdown is left on "End") and hit submit. Now, when you go back to the template selector, you should see your new template at the bottom of the list.
